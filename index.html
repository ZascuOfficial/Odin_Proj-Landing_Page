          <h1>ZASCU'S WEBSITE</h1>

          <p>
            Welcome to my first ever SERIOUS website! This page, specifically, was made for a curriculum known as <strong class="bolder">"The Odin Project".</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm actually very glad to announce that I learned a lot of new useful things about programming and web developing in general. And for that, I am very thankful to the team on the guide I was following. I hope you enjoy the design of this page in particular, because it was the first time that I started a project with an actual image that I wanted to achieve in my mind. A <em class="emphasized">professional</em>, and yet relaxed look.
          </p>

          <p>
            To anyone who visited, thank you!
          </p>

      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        My name, or my online pseudo-name that I like calling myself, is <strong class="bolder">Zascu.</strong> I am still a student, learning new things every day, useful or not useful, I will wait and see. My passion is coding. It's always been. Ever since I first wrote my first line of C++ back in 8th grade, I was caught on like a fish on a hook. My overall goal, that I am very determined to achieve, is to become a front-end (or full-stack, not decided as of yet) software engineer and, if possible, an UI/UX designer. With all that in mind, please remember I am still pretty new to all this (again, as of yet), so be patient.

        "Never give up. Try again, and again, until you are able to do it, or find something else equally as good as what you were trying to achieve. And while you're at it, have fun as well."
